# Pulse Deep Dive: Red Flags & Warning Signs

In Agentic Development, the biggest risk is not the AI failing. It is the Human failing to notice they have lost control.

Here are the 6 Warning Signs (Red Flags) that indicate you are drifting from the Pulse Framework.

---

## 1. "I don't understand the code anymore."
*   **Problem:** You have left the Agent running too long without a Review Pulse.
*   **Risk:** You are building a "Black Box". If it breaks, you cannot fix it.
*   **Solution:** **STOP.** Do not write another line of code. Switch to "Explanation Mode". Read the code line-by-line until you own it again.

## 2. "I just copy what the AI says."
*   **Problem:** You have become passive. You are the "Human-in-the-Loop" in name only.
*   **Risk:** The Agent will eventually hallucinate a security flaw or logic bug, and you will paste it in.
*   **Solution:** Challenge every output. Ask "Why did you do X?"

## 3. "Everything is getting slower and slower."
*   **Problem:** Technical Debt is piling up. The context window is polluted.
*   **Risk:** Development velocity crashes.
*   **Solution:** **Max Mode Review.** Stop feature work. Spend a day refactoring and cleaning.

## 4. "I can't do anything without AI anymore."
*   **Problem:** Skill Atrophy. You are forgetting how to write basic syntax.
*   **Risk:** You lose your ability to judge code quality.
*   **Solution:** **Manual Day.** One day a week, disable the AI. Code by hand to keep your "muscles" sharp.

## 5. "Agent keeps doing the same thing wrong."
*   **Problem:** Your `.cursorrules` or prompts are stale.
*   **Risk:** Frustration loop.
*   **Solution:** Update your documentation. If the Agent fails, it's usually because the instructions are bad.

## 6. "I am completely burned out."
*   **Problem:** High-Velocity "Vibe Coding" is dopamine-heavy and exhausting.
*   **Risk:** Bad decisions due to fatigue.
*   **Solution:** **Energy Management.** Take breaks. Respect the 90-minute limit.
